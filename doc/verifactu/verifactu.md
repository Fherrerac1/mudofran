# VerifactuController Documentation

## Overview

The `VerifactuController` is responsible for managing the integration with AEATâ€™s "VeriFactu" SOAP web service. It handles:

-   Sending invoices
-   Annulment (cancellation) of invoices
-   Sending invoice rectifications
-   Generating QR codes for invoice validation

This controller relies on:

-   A digital certificate (`.pfx`) for secure SOAP communication
-   XML templates rendered via Laravel Blade views
-   SOAP calls to AEAT's Verifactu system
-   QR code generation using `SimpleSoftwareIO\QrCode`

---
